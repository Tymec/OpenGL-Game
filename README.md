### A game made in C++ with a custom OpenGL engine

All I did was follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP) and to challange myself I tried to do it in Python first, but then I switched to C++. I never finished this project, but might do it in the future.
